# MMovie Flutter App
I have been living some difficulties when my cousins, friends, and siblings suggesting a movie to me, such as forgetting and missing messages. Thanks to the application we may have a digital movie archive, and we can share movies in easier way, we can create wish list and favourites list. I hope it would work as expected.
